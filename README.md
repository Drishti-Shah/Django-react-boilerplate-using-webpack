# Django-react Boilerplate

Hi guys... this is the basic django-react boilerplate code created by me to start with the combination of the best frontend framework 'reactjs' and the best backend framework 'django'.
You have to worry about nothing.... Just clone this code or download it as zip file and open it.
Install the backend requirements using the command
### - "pip install -r requirements.txt"
Install the frontend dependencies using the command
## - "npm install"
Now you will require two terminals to run the server.
In the first terminal run the command
# - "npm run dev"
And in the second terminal run the command
- "python manage.py runserver"
# All done....
# Just enjoy coding....
